<h1>Teaching</h1>

<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p>
My teaching practice is grounded in scientific rigor, conceptual clarity and the integration
of theory and practice. I aim to foster critical thinking, intellectual autonomy and problem-solving
skills, particularly in educational and organizational contexts.
</p>

<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
<p>
I have teaching experience across General, Technical-Vocational and Higher Education systems.
Since 2016, I have been teaching at the Polytechnic Institute of Queen Njinga a Mbande University,
lecturing courses in Mathematics, Education and Management-related fields.
